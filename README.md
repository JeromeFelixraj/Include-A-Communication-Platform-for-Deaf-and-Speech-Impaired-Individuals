Include
Overview

Include is an inclusive, AI-powered communication platform designed to assist deaf and speech-impaired users through accessible, real-time interaction. The platform focuses on reducing communication barriers by enabling multiple modes of communication beyond traditional audio-based systems.

Features

Speech to Text
Converts spoken language into readable text in real time.

Text to Speech
Converts typed text into spoken output for verbal communication.

Speech to Visualization
Transforms speech into visual representations to support deaf users.

Sign to Speech (MediaPipe-based)
Uses MediaPipe for hand and gesture tracking to recognize sign language gestures and convert them into spoken output, enabling communication for non-speaking users.

Chatbot Integration
Provides automated responses and conversational assistance.

AI Agent
An intelligent agent capable of understanding user commands, responding verbally, and performing basic tasks.

Motivation

Most communication platforms rely heavily on audio, making them inaccessible to deaf and speech-impaired individuals. Include is built with an accessibility-first approach, allowing users to communicate using speech, text, signs, and visual representations without dependence on a single modality.
